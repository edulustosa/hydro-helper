## Key Features

- **Track Water Consumption:** Users can log their water intake and monitor progress towards their daily goal.
- **Calculate or Define a Daily Goal:** The extension calculates the daily intake using the formula $BodyWeight(kg) * 40$, but users can set a personalized goal.
- **Send reminders:** Users can opt for notifications every 90 minutes through Chrome to prompt water intake. Notifications are automatically discontinued once the user reaches their set goal.
